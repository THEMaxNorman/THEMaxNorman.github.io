# The first part in a two part series!

Last March I decided I was going to start going fishing more as it was a relaxing way to spend my free time. So I started by buying the cheapest rod in BI-Mart. It is fairly hideous but so far it has worked well until I dropped it on the ground as I was putting it into my car while I was heading to the coast. The top eyelet broke off and I had to replace it.
